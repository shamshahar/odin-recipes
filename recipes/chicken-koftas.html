  <h1>Chicken Koftas</h1>
  <p>These chicken koftas will turn out tender and moist no matter which way you choose to cook them—broiled, grilled, or air-fried. Beautifully seasoned with aromatic herbs and spices, they’re perfect for summer eating.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup coarsely chopped sweet onion</li>
    <li>1 cup packed fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems</li>
    <li>1/2 cup packed fresh mint leaves</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 jalapeño chile, stemmed and coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground chicken (8% fat)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup dry breadcrumbs or cornmeal</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Add onion, cilantro, mint, garlic, ginger, and jalapeño to a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, about 10 (1-second) pulses. Transfer mixture to a kitchen towel, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.</li>
    <li>Add squeezed onion mixture, ground chicken, breadcrumbs, oil, egg, garlic powder, salt, cumin, coriander, and black pepper to a large bowl; mix gently until thoroughly incorporated.</li>
    <li>With moistened gloved hands, shape chicken mixture into 12 (3x1-1/2-inch) cylinders and place on a baking sheet. (If grilling, shape mixture onto skewers).</li>
    <li>To Broil: Preheat the oven’s broiler and set a rack about 7 inches from the heat source. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, and coat with cooking spray. Arrange koftas in a single layer about 2 inches apart, and spray with cooking spray. Broil, flipping koftas halfway through cook time, until browned and a thermometer inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>To Grill: Preheat grill to medium, 350 to 400 degrees F (175 to 200 degrees C). Place skewers on oiled grates; grill, covered, flipping every 2 minutes, until charred and a thermometer inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes. Alternative Method: Heat a large oiled grill pan over medium-high, about 2 minutes. Add koftas to pan; grill, uncovered, flipping every 2 minutes, until charred and a thermometer inserted into center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>To Air-fry: Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C) for 2 minutes. Spray koftas with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, add koftas to air fryer basket in a single layer, and cook, flipping after 4 minutes, until browned and a thermometer inserted into center reads  165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 8 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
